The 4 Pillars of OOP

1 Inheritance
Inheritance allows you to not repeat code by passing properties to different classes and objects, typically through a hierarchy.

2 Polymorphism
Polymorphism is essentially when you have objects that all contain the same 'base' class, but otherwise can be very different from one another

3 Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a way to decouple different parts of your application so that when one part is changed, the other part of the app still
functions as expected without concern for the newly changed part of the app.

4 Abstraction
Essentially abstraction is a way to take something that's more complex and boil it down to something more simple. For instance, 
when you turn the volume up on the TV using your remote, there's all kinds of signals and frequencies going on, but really the end-user is just hitting the volume button.
Abstractions are better suited for when one doesn't care so much as to what's going on under the hood.
